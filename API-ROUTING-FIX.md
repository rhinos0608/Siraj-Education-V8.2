# ðŸš¨ API ROUTING FIX - Quick Guide

## Issue Summary
The frontend is getting 404 errors when trying to access backend API endpoints because the launcher.py proxy wasn't forwarding all routes correctly.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. âœ… **Launcher Proxy Routes**
Fixed the launcher.py to properly proxy ALL backend routes:
- `/api/*` â†’ Backend port 8000
- `/health` â†’ Backend port 8000  
- `/council/*` â†’ Backend port 8000

### 2. âœ… **Analytics Dashboard Functions**
Fixed the AnalyticsDashboard component which was trying to use non-existent functions from useSirajAPI hook.

## To Apply Fixes

1. **Stop the current running instance** (Ctrl+C)

2. **Restart the launcher**:
   ```bash
   python launcher.py
   ```

3. **The system should now work correctly** with:
   - âœ… `/health` endpoint accessible
   - âœ… `/council/archetypes` endpoint accessible
   - âœ… Analytics dashboard loading without errors
   - âœ… All API calls properly proxied to backend

## Architecture Reminder

```
Browser (Port 3000) â†’ Launcher Proxy â†’ Backend (Port 8000)
         â†“                    â†“              â†“
    React Frontend      Proxy Routes    FastAPI Backend
```

The launcher serves the React frontend on port 3000 AND proxies API calls to the backend on port 8000.

## Next Steps

If you still see errors after restarting:
1. Check that the backend is running on port 8000
2. Check browser console for any remaining errors
3. Clear browser cache if needed (Ctrl+Shift+R)
