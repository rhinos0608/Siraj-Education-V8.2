FIRST RUN SETUP:
⏳ Initial startup may take 5-10 minutes
📥 System downloads required AI models automatically
🌐 Requires internet connection for model downloads
⚡ Subsequent runs are much faster (30-60 seconds)

TROUBLESHOOTING:

🚫 If antivirus blocks the application:
   • Add folder to antivirus exclusions
   • Or temporarily disable real-time protection
   • The application is safe - it's just a large executable

🔒 If application won't start:
   • Right-click and "Run as Administrator"
   • Check that ports 8000 and 3000 are available
   • Ensure you have at least 2GB free disk space

🌐 If browser doesn't open automatically:
   • Manually navigate to: http://localhost:3000
   • Try: http://127.0.0.1:3000 as alternative

🏢 For corporate networks:
   • Contact IT if initial model download fails
   • System works offline after first setup
   • No external connections needed during normal use

❌ If system fails to start:
   • Check Windows Event Viewer for detailed errors
   • Try running from different location (not Desktop)
   • Ensure you extracted the full folder, not just the .exe
