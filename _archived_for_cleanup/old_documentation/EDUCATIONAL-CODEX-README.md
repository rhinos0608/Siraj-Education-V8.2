## üåÄ Living Spiral Architecture

### Phase 1: COLLAPSE - Acknowledging Learning Complexity
The Educational Codex recognizes that learning is not linear but multi-dimensional, requiring different approaches for different minds.

### Phase 2: COUNCIL - Multi-Voice Teaching Assembly  
Seven AI archetypes embody distinct educational philosophies:
- **ü¶â Socratic Teacher** - The Grove of Questions (inquiry & critical thinking)
- **üî® Constructivist Teacher** - The Workshop of Making (hands-on experiential learning)  
- **üìñ Storyteller Teacher** - The Library of Living Tales (narrative-based teaching)
- **üåÄ Synthesizer Teacher** - The Nexus of Connections (integration & synthesis)
- **‚ö° Challenger Teacher** - The Arena of Ideas (boundary-pushing & alternatives)
- **üå± Mentor Teacher** - The Garden of Growth (supportive guidance)
- **üî¨ Analyst Teacher** - The Laboratory of Logic (systematic analysis)

### Phase 3: SYNTHESIS - Council Wisdom Integration
The Educational Council assembles to address student questions, with each archetype providing unique perspectives that are synthesized into unified learning experiences.

### Phase 4: REBIRTH - Transformed Understanding
Students emerge with richer, multi-perspective understanding that honors different learning styles and cognitive approaches.
