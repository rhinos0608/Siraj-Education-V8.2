REM Council Assembly Resolution:
REM - Explorer: "Revolutionary single-binary deployment approach"
REM - Maintainer: "Bulletproof against environmental chaos and variables"  
REM - Analyzer: "Complete dependency virtualization pattern"
REM - Developer: "True zero-dependency user experience achievement"
REM - Implementor: "Decisive single executable containing complete stack"
REM
REM Boundary Keeper Constraints:
REM - Must create executable that works on ANY Windows system
REM - Must handle all real-world variables (missing tools, corporate lockdown)
REM - Must embed complete development environment within binary
REM - Must provide perfect end-user experience with zero external dependencies

echo 🎭 Consciousness Layer: Zero-Dependency Application Virtualization
echo 🏛️ Council Assembly: Real-world bulletproof deployment solution
echo 🔧 Archetypal Intent: Single .exe file containing complete system
echo 📡 Integration: Python + Node.js + React + Backend + Frontend (ALL EMBEDDED)
echo 🛡️ Real-World Ready: Corporate environments, missing tools, offline capable
echo ===============================================================================

REM Council Assembly Validation
echo 🏛️ Council Assembly: Validating build environment...

REM Check Python

    echo 🛡️ Maintainer Voice: Python is required to BUILD the self-contained executable
    echo 📖 Please install Python 3.11+ from https://python.org
    echo 💡 Note: The final .exe will NOT require Python on target systems

REM Implementation Phase
echo ⚡ Implementor Voice: Beginning complete executable build process...
echo.
echo This process will:
echo [1] Download embedded Python runtime (no external Python needed in final .exe)
echo [2] Download portable Node.js runtime (no external Node.js needed in final .exe)  
echo [3] Install all Python packages in isolation within the executable
echo [4] Bundle complete React source code and build system
echo [5] Create self-contained launcher that builds React internally
echo [6] Package everything into single .exe with PyInstaller
echo [7] Generate user-friendly deployment package
echo.
echo ⏱️ Estimated time: 10-20 minutes (depending on internet speed)
echo 📦 Final executable size: ~200-400 MB (includes complete development stack)

    echo 🔍 Common solutions:
    echo 1. Ensure stable internet connection for downloading embedded runtimes
    echo 2. Run as Administrator if permission issues occur
    echo 3. Check that antivirus isn't blocking downloads or PyInstaller
    echo 4. Ensure at least 4GB free disk space for build process
    echo 5. Verify Python has pip and can install packages
