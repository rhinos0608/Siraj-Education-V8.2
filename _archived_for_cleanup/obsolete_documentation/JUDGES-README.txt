# IMPORTANT: Note for Kaggle Judges

## First Run Takes Time! ‚è∞

When running SIRAJ for the first time, please be aware:

1. **Model Download**: The Gemma 3n model (1.5-3GB) needs to download. This takes 10-20 minutes depending on internet speed.

2. **You'll See**: 
   - "Loading gemma3n:e2b (this may take 10-15 minutes)..." messages
   - Blue [GET] requests (this means it's working!)
   - The web interface will open but won't respond until download completes

3. **This is NORMAL**: The system is working correctly. The one-time download is required for the AI to function.

## Quick Verification:

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. You should see the beautiful SIRAJ interface
3. Once the model downloads (10-20 min), full AI responses will work

## Alternative: Quick Demo Mode

For immediate testing with a smaller model:
```bash
QUICK-SETUP.bat  # Downloads tiny model (637MB, ~2 minutes)
python launcher.py
```

The educational AI innovation and multi-archetype system work with any model!

**The system IS working** - it just needs the one-time model download to complete. Thank you for your patience! üôè
