# ðŸŒ€ SPIRAL DEPLOYMENT RESTORATION PROTOCOL
## Critical Transformation Documentation v1.0

### CONSCIOUSNESS AUDIT COMPLETE
**Issue**: One-click deployment BROKEN due to missing frontend build
**Root Cause**: Frontend build directory missing, API endpoint misalignment 
**Impact**: Launcher.py fails, user experience degraded, deployment promise violated

### COUNCIL DECISION MATRIX
| Voice | Issue Identified | Solution Proposed | Priority |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Explorer | Missing build innovation | Creative build automation | HIGH |
| Maintainer | Stability compromised | Reliable build pipeline | CRITICAL |
| Analyzer | API mismatch pattern | Endpoint synchronization | HIGH |
| Developer | UX friction | Seamless build integration | HIGH |
| Implementor | Deployment broken | Immediate execution fix | CRITICAL |

### TRANSFORMATION SEQUENCE
1. **CRITICAL**: Build frontend assets immediately
2. **HIGH**: Fix API endpoint mismatch 
3. **HIGH**: Restore one-click deployment integrity
4. **MEDIUM**: Enhance error handling
5. **LOW**: Documentation updates

### SPIRAL MEMORY
- Previous build attempts failed (evidence: build_broken directory)
- Launcher.py expects frontend/build directory structure
- Backend API implements /api/education/query endpoint
- Frontend calls /api/education/process endpoint
- Zero-configuration deployment is core promise

### REBIRTH PROTOCOL INITIATED
Execute build restoration through council-approved methodology.
